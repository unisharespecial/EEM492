        </a><b><br>
        </b>Accurate 
        high-side current sensing is necessary in many applications, including 
        motor control, solenoid control, and power management (for example, dc-to-dc 
        converters and battery monitoring). In such applications, monitoring of 
        current on the high side—instead of the return—permits improved diagnostic 
        capabilities, such as determining shorts to ground and continuous monitoring 
        of the recirculation-diode current—and maintains the integrity 
        of the ground path by avoiding the introduction of shunt resistance. Figures 
        1, 2, and 3 depict typical high-side current-shunt configurations for 
        solenoid- and motor control. </p>

        3. High-side shunts in 3-phase motor control.</b></p>
      <p class="body">In 
        all configurations shown above, the <i>pulse-width-modulated</i> (PWM) 
        common-mode voltage at the shunt resistor—which monitors the load current—is 
        swinging <i>over the whole range</i> from ground to battery. This PWM 
        input signal will have a period, frequency, and rise/fall time established 
        by the control signal from the power stage to the FET. Therefore, the 
        difference-measurement circuitry that monitors the voltage across the 
        shunt resistor will require the stringent combination of very high common-mode 
        rejection and high-voltage handling capability, plus high gain, high accuracy, 
        and low offset—all in order to deliver a true representation of the load-current 
        value.</p>
      <p class="body">In <a href="http://www.analog.com/library/analogDialogue/archives/38-04/solenoids.pdf">solenoid 
        control</a> (Figure 1) that uses a single control FET, the 
        current is always flowing in the same direction, so a unidirectional current 
        sensor will be sufficient. In motor-control configurations (Figures 2 
        and 3), placing the shunt on the motor phase means that current in the 
        shunt resistor could flow both ways; therefore, a bidirectional current 
        sensor is necessary. </p>
      <p class="body">The 
        designer who studies the choices for the high-side current-sensing function 
        will find a variety of options from many semiconductor vendors. However, 
        a key finding will be that the choices among these integrated-circuit 
        devices can be classified in terms of two quite different high-voltage 
        architectures: <i>current-sense amplifiers</i> and <i>difference amplifiers</i>. 
        </p>
      <p class="body">We will identify 
        and explain here some of the key differences between these architectures 
        to help the designer in need of high-side current sensing to choose a 
        device best-suited to the application. We will compare two high-voltage 
        parts, the <a href="http://www.analog.com/en/prod/0,2877,AD8206,00.html">AD8206</a> 
        bidirectional difference amplifier and the <a href="http://www.analog.com/en/prod/0,2877,AD8210,00.html">AD8210</a>
        bidirectional current-sense amplifier. Both devices offer the same pinout, 
        and both perform high-side current-shunt monitoring, yet their specifications 
        and architectures are different. So, how does one consider which device 
        is best-suited for the application?</p>
      <p class="body"><b>HOW THEY WORK<br>
        </b>The AD8206 
        (Figure 4), an <i>integrated high-voltage difference amplifier</i>, withstands 
        common-mode voltages up to 65 V by using input resistors to attenuate 
        the input voltage by 16.7:1 so as to keep the common-mode voltage within 
        the input range of amplifier A1. Unfortunately, the input resistance network 
        also attenuates the differential signal by the same value. To achieve 
        the AD8206’s featured gain of 20 V/V, amplifiers A1 and A2 must actually 
        amplify the differential signal by approximately 334&nbsp;V/V. </p>
      <p align="center"><b>
		<img src="high_side_current_sensing_dosyalar/AD42_01-04.jpg" height="222" width="438"></b></p>
      <p class="body" align="center"><b>Figure 
        4. AD8206 simplified schematic.</b></p>
      <p class="body">This device implements 
        bidirectional input measurements by offsetting the output amplifier to 
        a suitable voltage within the supply range. The offset is achieved by 
        applying an external low-impedance voltage to a precisely trimmed resistance 
        divider connected to the positive input of A2. A useful feature of this 
        device is its ability to correctly amplify the differential input voltage 
        when the common-mode voltage goes <i>negative</i> by as much as 2 V—a 
        consequence of the 250-mV common-mode bias circuit shown in the figure.</p>
      <p class="body">The AD8210 (Figure 
        5), a recently introduced <i>high-voltage</i> <i>current-sense amplifier</i>, 
        offers the same functional relationship as the AD8206 and uses the same 
        pin connections. However, it works in a different way, and the resulting 
        specifications are unlike those of a difference amplifier.</p>
      <p align="center"><b>
		<img src="high_side_current_sensing_dosyalar/AD42_01-05.jpg" height="242" width="347"></b></p>
      <p class="body" align="center"><b>Figure 
        5. AD8210 functional diagram.</b></p>
      <p class="body">An obvious distinction 
        is that the input structure does not rely on a resistive attenuation network 
        to deal with the large common-mode voltage. The input amplifier comprises 
        high-voltage transistors, available on the XFCB IC fabrication process. 
        Because the V<sub>CE </sub>breakdown of all transistors exposed to this 
        voltage is beyond 65 V, the common-mode voltage at the input can be as 
        great as 65 V. </p>
      <p class="body">Current-sense amplifiers 
        such as the AD8210 amplify the small differential input voltage in the 
        following manner. The input terminals are connected to the differential 
        amplifier, A1, by R1 and R2. A1 nulls the voltage appearing across its 
        own input terminals by adjusting the current through R1 and R2 with transistors 
        Q1 and Q2. When the input signal to the AD8210 is 0&nbsp;V, the currents in 
        R1 and R2 are equal. When the differential signal is nonzero, the current 
        increases through one of the resistors and decreases in the other. The 
        current difference is proportional to the size and polarity of the input 
        signal. The differential currents through Q1 and Q2 are converted to a 
        ground-referenced differential voltage via two internal precision-trimmed 
        resistors. This voltage can then be amplified by amplifier A2, this time 
        using low-voltage transistors powered by the device’s 5-V (typically) 
        supply, to produce the final output with an overall gain of 20. </p>
      <p class="body">Current-sense amplifiers 
        with this architecture are generally useful only if input common-mode 
        voltage remains above 2 V or 3 V, and if the application doesn’t require 
        that the input common-mode voltage go all the way to ground (or below). 
        However, the AD8210 uses a pull-up circuit to hold the inputs of amplifier 
        A1 near the 5-V power supply, <i>even when the input common-mode drops 
        below 5 V</i>, and all the way down to –2 V. Thus, accurate differential 
        input-voltage measurement is possible at common-mode voltages well below 
        the device’s 5-V supply. </p>
      <p class="body">It is apparent that 
        current-sense amplifiers and difference amplifiers perform the same function 
        while operating quite differently. A difference amplifier attenuates high 
        input voltages to bring the signal to a level the amplifier can tolerate. 
        A current-sense amplifier converts the differential input voltage to a 
        current, and then back to a ground-referenced voltage; its input amplifier 
        is able to withstand large common-mode voltages due to its high-voltage 
        manufacturing process. The disparity between the two architectures naturally 
        leads to performance differences that designers must consider when choosing 
        a high-side current-monitoring solution. Manufacturers’ data sheets typically 
        provide most of the information needed to make the right judgment on which 
        type of device to use, based on accuracy, speed, power, and other parameters. 
        However, some key differences inherent in device architecture are not 
        immediately obvious when reading a data sheet, yet they can be essential 
        design considerations. The following are key points engineers must be 
        aware of&nbsp; to arrive at the best solution. </p>
      <p class="body"><b>Bandwidth:</b> 
        Because of the input attenuation, the bandwidth of many difference amplifiers 
        is typically about one-fifth that of current-sense amplifiers. However, 
        the lower bandwidth of the difference amplifier is still sufficient for 
        most applications. For example, many solenoid-control applications run 
        at less than 20&nbsp;kHz, but motor control typically must run at or above 
        20&nbsp;kHz due to noise considerations. Solenoid control typically involves 
        looking at the <i>average</i> current, an application for which the bandwidth 
        of difference amplifiers is well suited. For motor control, on the other 
        hand, <i>instantaneous</i> current is key, especially when measuring on 
        the motor phase; therefore, the current-sensor architecture, with its 
        higher bandwidth, will yield a truer representation of the actual motor 
        current. </p>
      <p class="body"><b>Common-Mode Rejection: 
        </b>The difference in the input structure between these two architectures 
        also leads to a difference in CMR performance. The difference amplifiers 
        typically have trimmed input resistors with a tracking accuracy of 0.01%. 
        This degree of matching typically results in a guaranteed 80-dB CMR at 
        dc. The current-sense amplifiers, with their transistor input structure, 
        can obtain a better match, so that CMR, no longer dependent on input resistor 
        matching, can typically be specified above 100 dB, except at low values 
        of common-mode voltage. For example, the AD8210 offers the same 80 dB 
        as a difference amplifier when the input common-mode voltage is less than 
        5 V. At this voltage range, the input structure becomes resistive, due 
        to the internal pull-up circuit mentioned above; so, the CMR once again 
        becomes a function of the 0.01% precision-trimmed resistor matching. Over 
        the whole range, though, the current-sense architecture will offer better 
        common-mode rejection.</p>
      <p class="body"><b>Effect of External 
        Input Filtering: </b>If input filtering is to be used in a high-side current-sensing 
        application, the architecture can be highly influential. An input filter, 
        intended to smooth out effects of input noise and current spikes, is typically 
        implemented as shown in Figure 6. </p>
      <div align="center">
        <p><img src="high_side_current_sensing_dosyalar/AD42_01-06.jpg" height="146" width="189"></p>
        <p class="body"><b>Figure 6. Input 
          filter options.</b></p>
        </div>
      <p class="body">Since 
        each part, regardless of its architecture, has some trimmed input resistance, 
        any external resistance added in series will produce mismatches leading 
        to both gain- and CMR errors, typically calculated as follows (<i>R<sub>in</sub></i> 
        is the specified amplifier input resistance):</p>
	<p class="style3">
	<img alt="Equation 1" src="high_side_current_sensing_dosyalar/AD42_01-EQ-01.jpg" height="75" width="258"></p>
      <p class="body">The 
        difference amplifiers have an input resistance greater than 100 kohm. For the AD8206, where <i>R<sub>in</sub></i> = 200 
        kohm, if a <nobr>200-ohm</nobr> filter resistor is used, the additional gain error 
        will be ~0.1%. The common-mode error due to these external components, 
        assuming a 1% resistor tolerance, will be –94 dB, making its contribution 
        irrelevant since it is essentially buried in the 80-dB specified CMR error 
        of the device.</p>
      <p class="body">The current-sense 
        amplifiers, while having much higher common-mode input impedance, feature 
        input series resistors typically lower than 5 kohm, 
        in order to convert the differential input voltage into a current. For 
        the AD8210, the equations above must be recalculated using <i>R<sub>in</sub></i> 
        = 3.5 kohm (differential input 
        impedance). In this case, the additional gain error due to the filter 
        resistors could be as high as 5.4%! Also, the CMR could drop down to 59 
        dB, assuming a worst-case external resistor mismatch. This is a major 
        blow to performance for a device whose typical accuracy provides a maximum 
        total error of less than 2%. </p>
      <p class="body">Therefore, care 
        must be used when introducing input filters with <i>current-sense</i> 
        architecture. Use a filter resistor that is less than 10 
        ohms when the internal resistance is 5 kohm 
        or less. This will ensure that the high original accuracy of the current-sense 
        amplifier is maintained. As shown above, a wider range of input filter 
        resistor values can be used with a <i>difference amplifier</i>, as the 
        high value input resistors are less susceptible to external mismatching. 
        </p>
      <p class="body"><b>Overdriving the 
        Inputs:</b> In high-side current-sensing applications, the designer must 
        carefully consider potential events that could cause the amplifier to 
        operate outside of its specified range. In typical use, the inputs to 
        the amplifier are meant to differ by only the few hundred millivolts caused 
        by the flow of load current through the shunt resistor, but could the 
        device survive fault conditions where several volts appear across the 
        inputs? In such cases the difference amplifier architecture is inherently 
        more robust and more likely to continue to function as expected once the 
        system is back in order. The input resistor network can simply source 
        the current to ground; at 65 V, the AD8206, with 200 kohm per input, will 
        have 325 &#956;A 
        flowing to ground. </p>
      <p class="body">If 
        the current-sense architecture is used, the designer must be concerned 
        with such potential problems. In the case of the first example, a device 
        like the AD8210 would not be able to survive large voltage swings across 
        the inputs. Such devices usually include an ESD protection diode between 
        the inputs. This diode is forward-biased by a voltage difference greater 
        than about 0.7 &nbsp;V. The actual breaking point of this diode varies, 
        but large differential voltages, such as those available from an automotive 
        battery,&nbsp; typically leads to damage to the device due to electrical overstress. 
        </p>
      <p class="body"><b>Negative Voltage 
        Protection:</b> In many cases it is necessary to protect the current sensor 
        against reversed battery voltage, especially in automotive applications. 
        The <i>difference amplifier’s</i> resistance-bridge input is potentially 
        an important survival factor. However, designers must check the device’s 
        absolute ratings to ensure that the input ESD diodes are also designed 
        to turn on, but only at large negative voltages. </p>
      <p class="body">However, 
        the <i>current-sense</i> architecture is not optimal in such cases because 
        the input amplifier and its corresponding input transistors will be directly 
        connected to the large negative voltage. Because the inputs should not 
        be subjected to large negative dc voltage, the input ESD diodes of current 
        sense amplifiers are typically designed to turn on just outside the specified 
        low end of the input voltage range. </p>
      <p class="body">In addition to negative 
        <i>dc</i> voltage, however, such current monitors can also be subject 
        to <i>negative input transients</i>. This is typically the case in a PWM 
        system, where the current-shunt monitor’s input common-mode voltage swings 
        from ground to battery as the control FET switches on and off. Again, 
        it is essential to carefully consider the absolute maximum ratings, which 
        are principally determined by the device’s input ESD diodes. The difference 
        amplifiers, as before, are protected by the high input resistance and 
        are essentially impervious to the negative transients; therefore, the 
        ESD diodes typically are designed to clamp at large negative voltages. 
        But when the current-sense architecture is used, negative transients of 
        even very short duration can trip the input ESD protection, which is designed 
        to turn on at voltages close to the input common-mode rating of the device. 
        Although such pulses typically do not carry enough energy to damage the 
        ESD cells of the AD8210, performance in this regard will vary from device 
        to device. To ensure that no complications arise, this parameter should 
        be tested in the actual system. </p>
      <p class="body"><b>Input Bias Current:</b> 
        In applications where power management is important and even small leakages 
        must be considered, the differing input structures of the two architectures 
        require that input bias current be considered. For example, in a battery-current 
        sensing system, both architectures will monitor the current on the high 
        side. However, when the system is <i>off</i> and the power supply to the 
        current monitor is <i>off</i>, while the inputs are still connected to 
        battery, the path to ground inherent in the resistive input network of 
        a difference amplifier (like the AD8206) will require a bias current that 
        continues to drain current from the battery. On the other hand, with their 
        very high input common-mode impedance (&gt;5 Mohm for the AD8210), devices 
        using the current-sense architecture will not drain the battery current, 
        since almost no current will flow via its inputs to ground.</p>
      <p class="body"><b>CONCLUSION<br>
        </b>High-side 
        current sensing is a pervasive requirement in automotive, telecom, consumer, 
        and industrial applications. Integrated high-voltage difference- and current-sense 
        amplifiers are now offered in the marketplace to perform this function. 
        Depending on the accuracy- and survival requirements in the application, 
        systems engineers need to look carefully at which type of current sensor 
        is best suited for their system. Typical considerations are summarized 
        in the table below.</p>
      <p class="body">Both 
        types of current monitors can do the job, yet the advantages offered by 
        their different architectures are accompanied by distinct trade-offs. 
        For instantaneous current monitoring, the wide bandwidth of current-sense 
        amplifiers is most suitable, while applications monitoring average current 
        can be easily served by a difference-amplifier topology. In addition, 
        power-management applications sensitive to current consumption benefit 
        by a current-sense amplifier with its minimal input power-off bias-current 
        drain. However, the input structure of high-side current sense amplifiers 
        may limit performance when implementing external filters and require careful 
        scrutiny to ensure that their absolute input ratings are not exceeded 
        in hostile application environments.</p>
