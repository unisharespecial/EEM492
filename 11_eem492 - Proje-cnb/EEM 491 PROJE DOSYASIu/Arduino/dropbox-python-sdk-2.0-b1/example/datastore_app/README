This is a simple Flask app that shows how to use the Dropbox Datastore
API via the Python SDK.  It interoperates with the JavaScript, iOS and
Android tutorial apps.

(For Flask, see http://flask.pocoo.org/ .)

How to use
----------

0. To create an app, go to https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps

1. Edit the configuration in the tasks.py file. You'll need to set the
   DROPBOX_APP_KEY and DROPBOX_APP_SECRET to the app key and app
   secret of your Dropbox app.  Make sure to add
   http://localhost:5000/dropbox-auth-finish to the OAuth redirect
   URLs in your Dropbox app configuration.

2. Now you can run the tasks.py file with your python interpreter and
   the application will greet you on http://localhost:5000/.  Be sure
   to install the dropbox package, or set PYTHONPATH to include the
   directory up two levels, for example:

       PYTHONPATH=../.. python tasks.py
